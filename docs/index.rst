XinaBox OC05
*************

The OC05 xChip is an 8-channel servo motor driver. It is based on the popular `PCA9685 <https://www.nxp.com/products/analog/interfaces/ic-bus/ic-led-controllers/16-channel-12-bit-pwm-fm-plus-ic-bus-led-controller:PCA9685>`_ manufactured by NXP Semiconductor. It is supported by a BU33SD5 regulator to drive and accurately control up to 8 servo motors on a single module and act as system power supply. The module has 8 standard 2.54 mm (0.1") servo headers, plus 1 standard 2.54 mm (0.1") battery/BEC input header.

Please note, OC05 and all other xChips is currently only supported in Zerynth Studio with `XinaBox CW02 <https://docs.zerynth.com/latest/official/board.zerynth.xinabox_esp32/docs/index.html>`_. Review the `Quick Start <https://wiki.xinabox.cc/Quick-Start>`_ guide for interfacing xChips.
